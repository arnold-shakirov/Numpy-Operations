# Numpy Operations Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of NumPy for performing various operations on arrays. NumPy is a powerful library in Python used for scientific computing, particularly with multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. The `numpy-operations.py` script contains examples and implementations of basic to advanced array operations using NumPy.

## Features
- **Array Creation**: Demonstrates how to create different types of NumPy arrays, including 1D, 2D, and multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Performs element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on arrays.
- **Statistical Functions**: Calculates basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and sum of arrays.
- **Reshaping and Slicing**: Shows how to reshape and slice arrays for more complex operations.
- **Broadcasting**: Demonstrates the power of NumPy broadcasting for performing operations on arrays of different shapes.

## Project Structure
- **`numpy-operations.py`**: The main Python script that contains various NumPy operations and demonstrations.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python is installed.
- **NumPy**: You need to have NumPy installed. You can install it using `pip`.

### Installation of NumPy
To install NumPy, use the following command:
```bash
